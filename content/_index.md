My name is Denis Zygann. I’m a passionate Software Engineer from Flensburg. A city in the north of Germany. 
I love to develop software applications and learn new technologies. 
I'm also interested in all tools around the software lifecycle and the protection on different levels.

In 2014 I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in computer science. 
Then I started to work on a team of 8 people in a consulting company. 
We developed software for technical writers, which is built up with Java and the Eclipse Rich Client Platform. 
After two years I had the opportunity to change my position and I took the chance. 
I worked on Java EE and web technologies in connection to the SAP LO-VC for an international Danish company.

Since 2017 I’m working on the SAP Commerce Cloud solution. I passed the developer training and became more familiar with the e-commerce platform. 
One of my first projects was to build up a Storefront in connection with the CPQ extension to configure products and support my customer to implement his business cases. 

Since 2019 I work for a telecommunication provider as a software engineer. 
Still SAP Commerce Cloud but with additional extensions like the configurablebundleservice to bundle digital and hardware products.

In the end, I love to create software that helps people to achieve their dreams.

My name is Denis Zygann. I’m a passionate Software Engineer from Flensburg. I’m working for a consulting company, which supports manufacturing companies to create software solutions. In my position, I’m responsible for a Danish customer and supports him to create software solutions in connection with their SAP backend.

In 2014 I graduated my Bachelor of Science in computer science. Then I have started to work on a team of 8 people. We have developed a software for technical writers, which is build up with Java and the Eclipse Rich Client Platform. After two years I had the opportunity to change my position and I took the chance. Since then I working on Java EE technologies and the SAP LO-VC.

Since 2017 I’m working with the SAP Hybris technology. I passed the developer training and became more familiar with the Hybris platform. I created an application with the CPQ extension to configure products and support my customer to implement his business cases.
